        My web development journey
      </h4>
      <p className="text-white text-lg">
        I am a front-end web developer. But my journey in this web development
        course was not easy at all for me. I have faced various adversities
        during this journey. I started this course against everyone&apos;s will
        and there is no challenge for myself that I have to do it if everyone
        can do it, so can I. At first, I would make many mistakes and I would
        face many problems. Then I would solve them again with great difficulty.
        After a while, I started enjoying studying these problems and until they
        were solved, I would not get up for work. This is how little by little I
        am a successful web developer today. Since childhood, I had a slight
        inclination towards programming, apart from that, I also liked bike
        riding. I also had a hobby bike before doing this course. When my family
        did not give me money to buy a laptop for this course, I sold my hobby
        bike and bought a laptop and other related things and gave my full focus
        here. Selling my bike and all this trouble is worthwhile today.
